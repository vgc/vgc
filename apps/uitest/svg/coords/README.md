These examples are from the
[Coordinate Systems, Transformations and Units](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html)
chapter of the SVG 1.1 Specification.

The examples with `-notext` at the end of the file name are the same examples
but with the text converted to paths, to be able to view them in renderers
that do not support text.
