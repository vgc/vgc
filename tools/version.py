#
# Suite
# -----
#
# We call a "suite" a group of related apps which are designed to be installed
# together and share resources, such as DLLs, images, fonts, etc.
#
# For example, "Adobe CC" and "Open Office" are suites. In our case, we are
# developing a suite named "VGC". You can change this name if you are forking
# the project.
#
# Version type
# ------------
#
# We call "version type" one of the following: "stable", "beta", and "alpha".
#
# Builds of VGC with different version types are considered to be different
# programs, and are installed side-by-side in different folders, e.g.:
#
# - C:/Program Files/VGC/
# - C:/Program Files/VGC Beta/
# - C:/Program Files/VGC Alpha/
#
# Note that other things determine whether different versions can be installed
# side-by-side, such as the "upgrade policy". See vgc/tools/windows/wix.py for
# more details.
#
# Version number (major and minor)
# --------------------------------
#
# Alpha versions don't have any version number associated with them. Both
# versionMajor and versionMinor are empty strings.
#
# Beta versions only have a major version number associated with them, e.g.,
# "2020". versionMinor is an empty string.
#
# Stable versions have both a major and minor version number, e.g., 2020.0.
#
# Commit branch
# -------------
#
# This is the Git branch this commit belongs to.
#
# But let's clarify this because it's not as obvious as it seems. In theory,
# in Git, a commit doesn't "belong to" any branch. A commit is just a node of
# a directed acyclic graph, and a branch is just a reference to one such node.
# In other words, a branch is not a set of commits, it's just one commit. Most
# commits don't have any branch associated with them, as far as Git is
# concerned.
#
# However, in practice, and regardless of how Git works internally, most
# projects are following a branching model to organize development. In such
# models, the word "branch" usually does not mean a reference to a single
# commit, but rather means the "whole branch" more similarly to what a branch
# means for real living trees. This is what we mean by "commit branch", and it
# is quite well defined, even though git isn't aware a it. Here is our
# definition:
#
#   For any given commit, we define its "commit branch" to be the name of the
#   checked out branch when this commit was created.
#
# Indeed, when a commit is first created, there is one and only one branch
# that references this commit, which is the branch currently checked out. This
# is what we call the commit branch, and it never changes. Let's take the
# following sequence of commands as examples:
#
# - git checkout master:
#     HEAD is a commit (let's call it c1) belonging to the master branch.
#
#       --o--o c1 (master)
#
# - git checkout -b 2020:
#     A new release branch is created, but for now it still references the same
#     commit c1, belonging to master.
#
#       --o--o c1 (master, 2020)
#
# - bump_version.sh && git commit:
#     Now, a new commit is created, let call it c2. This new commit belongs to
#     the branch "2020".
#
#              o c2 (2020)
#             /
#       --o--o c1 (master)
#
# - git checkout master && git checkout -b gh62:
#     We've created a new topic branch "gh62" off master, say, to fix a bug.
#     The new topic branch still points to c1, belonging to master.
#
#              o c2 (2020)
#             /
#       --o--o c1 (master, gh62)
#
# - fix_bug.sh && git commit:
#     A new commit is created, let call it c3, fixing the bug. This new commit
#     belongs to the branch "gh62".
#
#              o c2 (2020)
#             /
#       --o--o c1 (master)
#             \
#              o c3 (gh62)
#
# - fix_bug_2.sh && git commit:
#     A new commit is created, let call it c4, improving the bug fix based on
#     feedback from code review. This new commit belongs to the branch "gh62".
#
#              o c2 (2020)
#             /
#       --o--o c1 (master)
#             \
#              o--o c4 (gh62)
#
# - git checkout master && git merge --squash gh62:
#     The bug-fix is squash-merged to master. This creates a new commit c5,
#     containing all the changes introduced in gh62. c5 belongs to master.
#
#              o c2 (2020)
#             /
#       --o--o--o c5 (master)
#             \
#              o--o c4 (gh62)
#
#     (Alternatively, one could also use "git merge --no-ff gh62", which would
#      also create a new commit c5 belonging to master)
#
# - git branch -D gh62:
#     The branch gh62 is deleted. The commits c3 and c4 are now orphaned and
#     can be considered deleted.
#
#              o c2 (2020)
#             /
#       --o--o--o c5 (master)
#             \
#           (  o--o c4  ) <- orphaned
#
# - git checkout 2020 && git cherry-pick c5:
#     The bug-fix is cherry-picked for inclusion in the 2020 release. This
#     creates a new commit c6, containing all the changes introduced by c5
#     (originally introduced by gh62). c6 belongs to 2020.
#
#              o--o c6 (2020)
#             /
#       --o--o--o c5 (master)
#             \
#           (  o--o c4  ) <- orphaned
#
# In summary, any commit can be attributed a "commit branch":
#
# master: c1, c5
# 2020: c2, c6
# gh62: c3, c4 (now orphaned)
#
# Commit index
# ------------
#
# Count how many ancestors of this commit have the same commitDate as this
# commit. This makes it possible to uniquely identify a commit in a
# human-friendly way:
#
#   commitBranch.commitDate.commitIndex   (example: master.2019-07-10.0)
#
# However, note that topic branches are short-lived and eventually deleted, so
# for commits on a topic branch, this can only be a short-term identifier and
# does not entirely replace the commit hash.
