/// \brief A sketch pass that removes duplicate points.
///
/// This sketch pass removes input points that are within
/// `RemoveDuplicatesSettings::distanceThreshold()` of their previous point.
///
/// When input points are considered duplicates, then the corresponding output
/// point has the following properties:
///
/// - Its position and timestamp is the same as the first duplicate input
/// point (except for the last output point, see below).
///
/// - Its pressure and width is the same as the duplicate input point that has
/// the greater pressure. This more closely matches what the stroke would look
/// like if the duplicates were not removed.
///
/// If the output has at least two points ([..., p, q]), then the position and
/// timestamp of the last output point q is the same as the input point r,
/// among all input points merged into q, whose position is further away from
/// the second-last output point p.
///
/// Example (distance threshold of 1):
///
/// ```
/// Input:  [(0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 10), (0, 10.1), (0, 9.9)]
/// Output: [(0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 10.1)]
/// ```
///
/// Note that while this pass guarantees that the first output point has the
/// same position as the first input point, it does NOT guarantee that the last
/// output point has the same position as the last input point. Indeed, in the
/// general case, this would be impossible to satisfy (at least not without
/// inventing points) while also satisfying the distance threshold between all
/// output points.
///
/// Example (distance threshold of 1):
///
/// ```
/// Input:  [(0, 0), (0, 0.1)]
/// Output:  [(0, 0)]
/// ```
///
/// In the example above, we do not want the output to be `[(0, 0), (0, 0.1)]`,
/// since the points would not satisfy the distance threshold between all
/// output points.
///
/// Also consider the following example (distance threshold of 1):
///
/// ```
/// Input:  [(0, 0), (0, 1.1), (0, 0.9)]
/// Output:  [(0, 0), (0, 1.1)]
/// ```
///
/// In the example above, we do not want the output to be `[(0, 0), (0, 0.9)]`
/// since it would not satisfy the distance threshold either.
