/// \class vgc::widgets::PointingDeviceEvent
/// \brief Stores information about pointing device events such as mouse
/// events, tablet events, etc.
///
/// Context: in Qt, there exist several classes inheriting QEvent which are
/// about pointing device events, such as QMouseEvent and QTabletEvent. These
/// are handled in various event handlers, such as mousePressEvent(),
/// mouseMoveEvent(), mouseReleaseEvent, and tabletEvent().
///
/// However, it is often useful to handle all these events similarly, which
/// means that we delegate most of the functionality to delegate functions that
/// do not know or care whether the event was emitted from a mouse or a tablet.
/// This PointingDeviceEvent class is a convenient data holder to pass input
/// data to these delegates.
///
/// Note that PointingDeviceEvent does not inherit from QEvent. This is
/// intentional: we do not send this "event" via QCoreApplication::sendEvent()
/// or postEvent(), but rather we just instanciate a PointingDeviceEvent within
/// the existing Qt event handlers and directly call the delegate functions
/// without using the event queue. In a nutshell, this is not an actual Qt
/// event, but a convenient class to implement mouse and tablet events in a
/// uniform manner.
///
/// Currently, only mouse events and tablet events are supported by this class.
/// In the future, we might support other types of pointing device events, such
/// as QTouchEvent or QNativeGestureEvent.
///
/// \sa QEvent, QInputEvent, QMouseEvent, QTabletEvent.
