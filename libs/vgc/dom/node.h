/// \class vgc::dom::NodeIterator
/// \brief Iterates over a range of Node siblings.
///
/// This iterator class is a thin wrapper around Node*, where `operator++` is
/// implemented as `node->nextSibling()`. Together with NodeList, this
/// class enables range-based loops like the following:
///
/// \code
/// for (Node* child : node->children()) {
///     // ...
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// Typically, you never have to manipulate NodeIterators directly, but
/// keep them as an implementation detail for range-based loops. If you need
/// more fine-grain traversal, we recommend to directly use `Node*` as your
/// "iterator type", and use the methods Node::previousSibling() and
/// Node::nextSibling() to access neighbor nodes.
///
/// \sa NodeList and Node.
///
/// Past-last-child Iterator
/// ------------------------
///
/// There is a special sentinel value which we call the "past-last-child"
/// iterator, which is constructed by passing nullptr to the constructor of
/// NodeIterator.
///
/// Be aware that all node->children() share the same past-last-child iterator.
/// In other words:
///
///     node1->children().end() == node2->children().end()
///
/// Intuitively, this is because this past-last-child iterator is simply
/// implemented by storing a nullptr, that is, the iterator does not know what
/// is its "parent". This allows for a more intuitive API, stronger guarantees
/// on iterator validity (see next section), and slightly more efficient
/// implementation.
///
/// However, we note that this design choice is why our NodeIterator is not
/// bidirectional: we wouldn't be able to decrement the past-last-child
/// iterator. We decided that this was a minor concern since in the rare cases
/// where you'd need bidirectionality, you can simply use the Node API
/// directly.
///
/// Iterator Validity
/// -----------------
///
/// NodeIterators are always valid as long as the underlying Node* stays
/// valid. If the iterator is a past-last-child iterator, then it is always
/// valid.
///
/// In particular, deleting or inserting siblings of a given iterator keeps
/// this iterator valid. Reparenting or moving the location of a Node among its
/// sibling keeps the iterator valid. However, be careful to keep the end of a
/// range reachable! This is never a problem if the end of the range is the
/// past-last-child iterator, but can be in other cases.
///
/// Despite all of these guarantees, we recommend that whenever you're doing
/// anything else than a simple iteration over all children, you should simply
/// use the Node API (node->nextSibling(), etc.) instead of iterators. This is
/// even safer and more readable anyway.
