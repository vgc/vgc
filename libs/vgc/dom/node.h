/// Owner Document
/// --------------

/// Every alive node is owned by exactly one Document which you can query via
/// document(). This method is always guaranteed to return a valid non-null
/// Document*. This document is determined when the node is created, and never
/// changes in the lifetime of the node.
///
/// In particular, we intentionally disallow to move a node from one Document
/// to another. This is a design decision which was taken in order to make many
/// other more common operations faster, and to remove a lot of burden on
/// client code. For example, if a GUI widget stores a pointer to a Node, then
/// it never has to worry about the node moving from one Document to another,
/// and how to handle this appropriately.
