// # About VGC_FOO_API_EXCEPTION
//
// When compiling a DLL using MSVC on Windows, we don't export exception
// classes, and instead fully inline them. Otherwise, we get errors such as the
// following, due to std::logic_error (and other STL exceptions) not being
// exported themselves:
//
//   warning C4275: non dll-interface class 'std::logic_error' used as base
//   for dll-interface class 'vgc::core::LogicError'
//
// See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24511376/how-to-dllexport-a-class-derived-from-stdruntime-error
//
// However, when compiling with Clang on macOS, we do need to export the class,
// otherwise RTTI information isn't properly propagated across shared
// libraries. For example, in any VGC library other than vgc.core, pybind11
// would fail to dynamic cast our C++ exceptions and raise the proper Python
// exception. For example, in vgc/dom/tests/test_node.py:
//
//   def testReparentCycle(self):
//       doc = Document()
//       n1 = Element(doc, "foo")
//       n2 = Element(n1, "bar")
//       with self.assertRaises(ChildCycleError):
//           n2.reparent(n2)
//
//   => When compiling with Clang on macOS, with exported exceptions, the test
//      succeeds.
//
//   => When compiling with Clang on macOS, without exported exceptions, the
//      test fails, because the Python built-in exception RuntimeError is raised
//      instead of our custom vgc.dom.ChildCycleError.
//
// This is why we use the macro VGC_FOO_API_EXCEPTION: it enables conditional
// export of the class based on the given compiler/platform.
//
// Note that using GCC on Linux, it seems that exceptions work as excepted
// without warnings regardless of exporting the class or not.

/// \class vgc::core::LogicError
/// \brief Base class for all logic errors
///
/// This exception is raised whenever there is a logic error detected by VGC,
/// either because of a bug in a VGC function, or because the preconditions of
/// a VGC function are not met.
///
/// # How to handle VGC logic errors?
///
/// The recommended programming practice when calling a VGC function with
/// preconditions is to ensure that the preconditions are met, then call the
/// function without checking for exceptions.
///
/// Normally, you should never write a try/catch block to catch logic errors:
/// instead, the code should be fixed so that the exception is never raised.
/// However, there are at least a few rare cases where you may want to catch
/// logic errors:
///
/// 1. At a very high-level in the program architecture (for example, in
///    main()), in order to log the error, tell the user that an error occured
///    and how to recover automatically saved data, and close the program as
///    cleanly as possible.
///
/// 2. At the interface between C++ and Python, to convert C++ exceptions into
///    Python exceptions. In most cases, this should be automatically done by
///    pybind11 by registering the exception using pybind11::register_exception.
///
/// 3. You are writing a one-off Python script never to be used again, you are
///    under a very tight deadline, and you are somehow able to get the job
///    done faster by catching and ignoring the exception instead of ensuring
///    that preconditions are met. This is really not recommended: if a logic
///    error is raised, this might mean that some internal state of the program
///    is now corrupted and could result in data loss.
///
/// 4. If catching the exception is a known workaround for a bug in VGC which
///    is still not fixed, and which you cannot fix yourself. Make sure to
///    report all suspected bugs to https://github.com/vgc/vgc/issues to ensure
///    that they will get fixed in future versions of VGC.
///
/// # When to raise VGC logic errors?
///
/// If you are a developer of one of the VGC libraries, then if possible, it is
/// best to design your classes such that your public API has no preconditions,
/// which means that any possible input to your public functions is valid input
/// with documented behavior. In this case, you may choose to never raise logic
/// errors.
///
/// If a function in your public API has preconditions (for example, calling
/// pop() on an empty list makes no sense, therefore a precondition is that the
/// list is not empty), then you should check for these preconditions at the
/// beginning of the function, and raise a logic error if the preconditions are
/// not met. Note that it is sometimes a tricky design decision to decide
/// whether a given input is really non-sensical and should be documented as a
/// precondition, or whether it is simply a special case that should be treated
/// as valid input with documented behavior. For example, instead of raising an
/// exception, calling pop() on an empty list might return a
/// default-constructed element and keep the list empty. Use you best judgement
/// and take inspiration from existing libraries. For example, the built-in
/// Python list raises IndexError when calling pop() on an empty list,
/// therefore keeping the same behavior for similar functions is preferred.
/// Also, prefer using exceptions if you have good reasons to think that it may
/// help upstream clients detect bugs in their code that would otherwise be
/// unnoticed, or if it allows you to provide stronger post-conditions
/// (example: "this function never returns nullptr") which make upstream code
/// simpler and more readable. Avoid exceptions if it would be hard for users
/// to enforce these preconditions, or check whether they are met. Typically,
/// preconditions are for quite obviously non-sensical operations, such as
/// out-of-bound indices or well-known constraints (example: vgc::dom::Document
/// can only have one child Element, thus attempting to insert a second one
/// raises an exception).
///
/// Besides checking for preconditions, it might also be a good idea to check
/// internal invariants and postconditions if you are writing complex
/// algorithms, for ease of debugging and/or documentation. Raising logic
/// errors in case of failure is appropriate in this case, and is preferred
/// over the use of assert(). However, checking invariants and post-conditions
/// is a double-edged sword: be mindful of false-negative! You definitely do
/// not want to upset users by incorrectly raising an exception (e.g., a
/// precondition is met, but the code checking for the precondition has a
/// bug).Also, be mindful of performance: avoid checking for invariants if this
/// is an expensive operation. Here are some examples to provide guidance:
///
/// ```cpp
/// // Good: fast and simple checks for complex algorithms
/// Foo* foo = nullptr;
/// vgc::Int i = -1;
/// for (...) {
///     // Many lines of code, more bug-prone than average, which is supposed
///     // to guarantee that at the end, foo != nullptr and i >= 0.
/// }
/// if (!foo) {
///     throw vgc::core::LogicError("Foo not found!");
/// }
/// if (i < 0) {
///     throw vgc::core::LogicError("i is negative!");
/// }
///
/// // Best avoided: complex and/or expensive checks for complex algorithms
/// vgc::Int n = graph->numConnectedComponents();
/// for (const Node& node : findNodesToRemove_(graph)) {
///     connectNeighborNodes_(node);
///     removeNode_(node);
/// }
/// if (n != graph->numConnectedComponents()) {
///     throw vgc::core::LogicError("The number of connected components changed!");
/// }
///
/// // Bad: fast and simple checks for simple algorithms
/// vgc::Int j = i + 1;
/// if (j < i) {
///     throw vgc::core::LogicError("j smaller than i!");
/// }
///
/// // Very Bad: complex and/or expensive checks for simple algorithms
/// vgc::Int j = i + 1;
/// if (std::sqrt(j) > std::sqrt(i)) {
///     throw vgc::core::LogicError("sqrt(j) smaller than sqrt(i)!");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Finally, keep in mind that function input may come from various sources:
///
/// 1. C++ libraries: These are expected to know what they're doing. They should
///    ensure that preconditions are met before calling any function. Failure to
///    do so or to catch exceptions may result in a program crash. Such coding
///    error should normally be catched in unit tests or beta tests before
///    shipping stable versions.
///
/// 2. Python libraries: These are also expected to know what they're doing.
///    They should ensure that preconditions are met before calling any function.
///    Failure to do so results in a thrown C++ exception converted to a Python
///    exception which may stop the execution of your Python library. Such
///    coding error should normally be catched in unit tests or beta tests
///    before shipping stable versions.
///
/// 3. Python user scripts: These may be written by users with very little
///    programming experience, and such scripts might be executed for the first
///    time within an interactive session containing valuable artistic data. It
///    is still their responsability to ensure that preconditions are met
///    before calling any function, but failure to do so should not result in a
///    program crash. The exception is typically reported to the interactive
///    Python console, and the program should return to the most recent valid
///    state before the exception was thrown.
///
/// 4. Graphical user input: This should always be sanitized by code handling
///    the user input. Graphical users should never be expected to enter "valid"
///    input satisfying some preconditions. In other words, invalid input coming
///    from a non-programming user should never result in a raised logic error,
///    but instead the user should be notified in a friendly way of the invalid
///    input (e.g., popup), or better yet, the interface should make entering
///    such invalid input impossible, or auto-correct it (e.g., typing a
///    non-digit character in a spinbox is silently ignored).
///
/// # Why are we using exceptions for logic errors?
///
/// There is a commonly advocated guideline that using exceptions in C++ should
/// only be for runtime errors (e.g., out of memory, file permission issues,
/// etc.), and that using assert() instead should be preferred for logic errors
/// (e.g., calling mySqrt(x) where x is negative, dereferencing a null handle,
/// attempting to make a non-sensical topological operation, etc.). The
/// rationale is that these errors are in fact bugs in the code (while runtime
/// errors are not), and these should be catched and fixed in unit tests or
/// beta tests. If the bug is not fixed, then advocates of using assert() argue
/// that it is anyway unclear how we could recover from a bug we didn't know
/// about, and thus we might as well terminate the program and avoid
/// potentially corrupting more data. However, this guideline is quite
/// ill-advised in our case, because the low-level API is directly available to
/// users of the software via the Python console. Therefore, it is impossible
/// for C++ developers to fix logic errors coming from Python user code, and it
/// is a much better behavior to report the error to them as a Python exception
/// rather than crashing the application. Only them can decide whether they
/// prefer to fix the root cause of the error in their code, or use a
/// try/except/finally as a quick fix to get the work done. In fact, in Python,
/// it is much more common to use exceptions for logic errors as well as
/// runtime errors, exactly because the distinction between developer and user
/// is not always clear when the language is interpreted and can be used in an
/// interactive console, and also because a script is often written for a
/// one-time task with no unit testing. Therefore, we prefer to use C++
/// exceptions in a consistent way with how they are used in Python, which
/// makes creating bindings more straightforward.
///
/// In addition, it is quite pretentious to believe that we can catch and fix
/// all possible logic errors before shipping, and therefore throwing an
/// exception is much better: we can for example decide to catch it and send a
/// bug report automatically, so that we are aware of the problem and fix it in
/// future versions. One may argue that this is possible without using
/// exceptions: when the low-level library detect the error, it could itself
/// send the bug report just before calling abort(). However, this is in fact
/// not a good idea: first, there would be dependency issues (e.g., why should
/// vgc::dom depend on an internet protocol?), and second, the bug report
/// should only be sent if all the upstream code is VGC code and not user code,
/// and if the user agrees to do so, etc... which is information that the
/// low-level library detecting the error doesn't know about. And imagine a
/// third-party using the library for something entirely different: we
/// definitly do not want to receive bug reports for logic errors coming from
/// their code, nor they wish to use a library doing so, for many obvious
/// reasons! In a nutshell, throwing an exception is more flexible and useful
/// than crashing the app, even if it is a logic error. It defers the decision
/// of how to handle the exception to upstream code, which generally has way
/// more information to know what is the best course of action. In some cases,
/// terminating the application might indeed be the best choice, but in many
/// other cases it is not, and more importantly it shouldn't be the
/// responsibility of the low-level library to decide.
