/// \brief Provides a common API for object-based tree hierarchies.
///
/// Object is the base class of some of the most important classes in the VGC
/// codebase, such as ui::Widget and dom::Node. The Object class helps
/// implementing tree hierarchies where the destruction of an Object
/// automatically destruct its children.
///
/// Defining an Object subclass
/// ---------------------------
///
/// Object subclasses should typically be declared as follows:
///
/// ```cpp
/// VGC_DECLARE_OBJECT(Foo);
///
/// class Foo : public Object {
/// private:
///     VGC_OBJECT(Foo, Object)
///
/// protected:
///     Foo();
///     Foo(Foo* parent);
///
/// public:
///     static FooPtr create();
///     // and/or
///     static Foo* create(Foo* parent);
///     // and/or
///     Foo* createChild();
/// };
/// ```
///
/// These VGC_DECLARE_OBJECT and VGC_OBJECT macros may seem strange, so let's
/// provide some explanations below as to what they do.
///
/// The `VGC_DECLARE_OBJECT(Foo);` line simply expands to the following:
///
/// ```cpp
/// class Foo;
/// using FooPtr = vgc::core::ObjPtr<Foo>;
/// using FooConstPtr = vgc::core::ObjPtr<const Foo>;
/// ```
///
/// In other words, it forward-declares `Foo`, and declares `FooPtr` as an
/// alias for `vgc::core::ObjPtr<Foo>` (as well as a const variant).
///
/// The class template `ObjPtr<T>` is a smart pointer that should be used to
/// manage the lifetime of objects without a parent, which are called "root
/// objects". Objects which do have a parent are called "child objects", and
/// are automatically destroyed by their parents, so they shouldn't be managed
/// by an `ObjPtr<T>`. In most cases, you should just use a raw pointer `T*`,
/// such as in function parameters and return values, except in the rare cases
/// where ownership is involved, such as creating a new root object, or
/// detaching a child object from its parent.
///
/// The `VGC_OBJECT(Foo, SuperClass)` macro adds a few definitions common to
/// all objects, for example, it makes the destructor protected.
///
/// The constructors should always be protected, and sublasses should instead
/// provide either static functions like `Foo::create()` or
/// `Foo::create(parent)`, or member functions like `parent->createChild()`.
/// This ensures proper use of smart pointers: functions creating root objects
/// should return ObjPtrs, and functions returning child objects should return
/// raw pointers. Note that some Object subclasses may only allow to create
/// root objects, for example a `dom::Document` is always a root. Other may
/// only allow to create child objects, for example a `dom::Element` is always
/// a child object. The decision depends on the situation, and usually comes
/// from which invariants an Object subclass desires to enforce. For example, a
/// `dom::Element` always has a valid parent, and the root is always a
/// `dom::Document`.
///
///
/// Ownership model
/// ---------------
///
/// The ownership model of Object instances is a little peculiar: child objects
/// are uniquely owned by their parent, but the ownership or root objects is
/// shared among all ObjPtrs referencing them or any of their descendants.
///
/// One of the main reasons behind this design is to improve interoperability
/// between C++ (which doesn't have a garbage collector), and Python (which
/// does have a garbage collector).
///
/// In Python, all variables bound to VGC objects are using ObjPtrs under the
/// hood. This ensures that a root object isn't destroyed as long as at least
/// one of its descendant (including itself) is still referenced:
///
/// ```python
/// root = vgc.ui.Widget()
/// child = vgc.ui.Widget(root)
/// root = None     # Both root and child are kept alive
/// child = None    # Destroys child, then destroys root
/// ```
///
/// However, note that an ObjPtr referencing a child object doesn't guarantee
/// that the child object itself is kept alive: it only guarantees that its
/// root is kept alive. This is because parents have unique ownership of their
/// children, which means that they have full power to destroy any of their
/// children if they want to.
///
/// When trying to dereference an ObjPtr whose underlying object has already
/// been destroyed by its parent, a NotAliveError is raised.
///
/// Calling Conventions
/// -------------------
///
/// Functions manipulating instances of vgc::core::Object should be passed
/// these objects by raw pointers (that is, unless they participate in
/// ownership, which is rare). Unless stated otherwise, any function that takes
/// an Object* as argument assumes that the following is true:
///
/// 1. The pointer is non-null.
///
/// 2. The lifetime of the object exceeds the lifetime of the function.
///
/// Please watch the first 30min of following talk by Herb Sutter for a
/// rationale (or consult the C++ Core Guidelines):
///
/// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnqTKD8uD64
///
/// If an object is passed to a function by ObjPtr, this typically
/// indicates that the function takes ownership of the object. In this case,
/// pass the shared pointer directly by value, like so:
///
/// \code
/// myFunction(FooPtr foo);
/// \endcode
///
/// Miscellaneous Notes
/// -------------------
///
/// Since the destructor of Object is virtual, there is no need to explicitly
/// declare a (virtual) destructor in derived classes. In most cases, the
/// default destructor is the most appropriate.
