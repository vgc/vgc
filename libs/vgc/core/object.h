VGC_CORE_DECLARE_PTRS(Object);

/// \class vgc::core::Object
/// \brief Base class of most classes in the VGC codebase.
///
/// This base class allows the VGC codebase to be more readable, consistent,
/// maintainable, thread-safe, and Python-binding-friendly at only a very small
/// performance cost. It is strongly recommended that most classes derive,
/// directly or indirectly, from Object. In particular any class that contains
/// a `std::vector`, a `std::string`, any other container, or performs any sort
/// of memory allocation should typically inherit from Object, since the
/// overhead cost is unlikely to be significant compared to the existing cost.
/// Notable exceptions include small struct-like classes such as `Vec2d`: these
/// do not perform any dynamic allocation, are expected to be potentially
/// instanciated more than a million times in a session, and are expected or
/// measured to be a bottleneck if they would derive from Object.
///
/// Classes deriving directly or indirectly from Object should typically be
/// declared as follows, where Bar is either Object or one of its subclasses:
///
/// \code
/// class Foo: public Bar
/// {
///     VGC_CORE_OBJECT(Foo)
///
/// public:
///     // Effectively protected constructors
///     Foo(const ConstructorKey&);
///     Foo(const ConstructorKey&, int x);
///
///     // Factory methods
///     static FooSharedPtr create();
///     static FooSharedPtr create(int x);
/// };
/// \endcode
///
/// The macro VGC_CORE_OBJECT(Foo) defines the following public methods:
///
/// \code
/// FooSharedPtr sharedPtr();
/// FooWeakPtr weakPtr();
/// FooConstSharedPtr sharedPtr() const;
/// FooConstWeakPtr weakPtr() const;
/// \endcode
///
/// These methods can be used to convert a raw pointer into a smart pointer.
/// This is possible since vgc::core::Object inherits from
/// `std::enable_shared_from_this`.
///
/// In addition, VGC_CORE_OBJECT(Foo) defines a protected inner struct called
/// ConstructorKey. This allows to keep the constructors public (so that
/// std::make_shared has access to them), while still making them effectively
/// protected. For more details on this technique, see
/// https://stackoverflow.com/q/8147027/1951907. The other techniques that we
/// have tried (e.g., inheritance trick, custom allocator) either did not play
/// nice with pybind11, or failed to compile on some compilers.
///
/// Ownership Conventions
/// ---------------------
///
/// Despite being managed by shared pointers, objects should typically have a
/// clearly identified unique owner. This unique owner creates the object via
/// Foo::create(), stores the shared pointer as a member variable `FooSharedPtr
/// foo_`, but then always passes the raw pointer foo_.get() to other methods
/// and clients (= "observers").
///
/// Observers should typically access and manipulate observed objects via
/// raw pointers. If they desire to "remember" an object, the recommended
/// way is to simply store the raw pointer as a member variable, and register
/// for signals to be notified in case the object is destructed. If the
/// observed object is guaranteed to outlive the observer via other contracts,
/// just store the raw pointer without registering for signals. At a last
/// resort, if it isn't possible or practical to register for signals, and if
/// you do not have guarantees on the lifetime of the observed object, then you
/// may call obj->weakPtr() and store the weak pointer as a member variable,
/// which allows you to check for expiration at a later point:
///
/// \code
/// class Bar {
///     FooWeakPtr foo_;
///
/// public:
///     void Bar::setFoo(foo* foo) { foo_ = foo->weakPtr(); }
///
///     void Bar::bar() {
///         if (Foo* foo = foo_.lock()) {
///             /* do something */
///         }
///         else {
///             foo_.reset();
///         }
///     }
/// };
/// \endcode
///
/// Under almost no circumstances you should convert a raw pointer to a shared
/// pointer and hold this shared pointer as a member variable (that is, unless
/// you actually desire to share ownership, which is rare). Indeed, holding
/// such shared pointer would defer the destruction of the object, and goes
/// against good RAII design. A notable exception are Python bindings: many
/// Python bindings of C++ classes internally hold a shared_ptr, because the
/// concept of weak reference is not very pythonic. Indeed, most Python
/// developers expect that objects stay alive as long as at least one Python
/// variable references the object.
///
/// Of course, never call `new` or `delete` to manually manage the lifetime of
/// vgc::core::Object instances.
///
/// Calling Conventions
/// -------------------
///
/// Functions manipuling instances of vgc::core::Object should be passed these
/// objects by raw pointers (that is, unless they participate in ownership,
/// which is rare). Unless stated otherwise, any function that takes an Object*
/// as argument assumes that the following is true:
///
/// 1. The pointer is non-null.
///
/// 2. The lifetime of the object exceeds the lifetime of the function.
///
/// 3. Converting to smart pointers is safe.
///
/// Please watch the first 30min of following talk by Herb Sutter for a
/// rationale (or consult the C++ Core Guidelines):
///
/// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnqTKD8uD64
///
/// If an object is passed to a function by shared pointer, this typically
/// indicates that the function takes ownership of the object. In this case,
/// pass the shared pointer directly by value, like so:
///
/// \code
/// myFunction(FooSharedPtr foo);
/// \endcode
///
/// Miscellaneous Notes
/// -------------------
///
/// Since the destructor of Object is virtual, there is no need to explicitly
/// declare a (virtual) destructor in derived classes. In most cases, the
/// default destructor is the most appropriate.
///
/// http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three
/// https://blog.rmf.io/cxx11/rule-of-zero
/// http://scottmeyers.blogspot.fr/2014/03/a-concern-about-rule-of-zero.html
///
/// Note that the copy constructor, move constructor, assignement operator, and
/// move assignement operators of Object are all declared private. This means
/// that objects cannot be copied. If you desire to introduce copy-semantics to
/// a specific subclass of Object, you must manually define a clone() method.
///
/// In some cases, destructions of objects with deeply nested ownership of
/// other pointers may run into stack overflow issues. In these cases, it may
/// be appropriate to implement a custom destructor in order to derecursify the
/// destructions. See the following example by Herb Sutter in the case
/// `unique_ptr`, but the advice applies equally well to `shared_ptr`:
///
