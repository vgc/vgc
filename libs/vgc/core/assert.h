/// Aborts the program if the provided \p condition is false.
///
/// Use assertions whenever useful for testing pre-conditions, post-conditions,
/// invariants, and intermediate checks that should be provable at class-level
/// or file-level, but which are not immediately obvious from the few couple of
/// lines of code above. Assertions are useful as fine-grain checks during
/// initial development and unit tests, but perhaps more importantly, they are
/// useful as documentation: they inform future maintainers of intent and
/// provide them with important conditions to keep in mind when refactoring.
///
/// Example:
///
/// \code
/// // Good
/// void Foo::privateFunction_() {
///     VGC_CORE_ASSERT(p_);
///     p_->doSomething();
/// }
///
/// // Not as good
/// void Foo::privateFunction_() {
///     // Here, we know that p_ is non-null, which is why we do not check the
///     // validity of p_ before deferencing it. To future maintainers: when
///     // refactoring, make sure that p_ is valid before calling this function.
///     p_->doSomething();
/// }
///
/// // Bad (unless it is a well-known class invariant that p_ is never null)
/// void Foo::privateFunction_() {
///    p_->doSomething();
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// A typical use case for assertions is to verify that a supposedly non-null
/// pointer is indeed non-null. Or that an index is within a specified range.
/// Or that some given loop did find an element that was supposed to be there.
///
/// Never use assertions for testing the validity of input from end users of
/// even from client code. Instead, invalid input from end users should emit a
/// user-visible warning and fail gracefully, and invalid input from client
/// code should either emit a warning and fail gracefully, or possibly throw an
/// exception if recovery can only be handled at higher level.
///
/// Assertions should be extremely readable and fast to compute one-liners. As
/// a rule of thumb, if implementing the assertion would take you more than
/// 10sec, then don't implement it and instead write a comment. Keep in mind
/// that while a bug in production code is bad, a bug in assertion code is even
/// worse: indeed, false positives may make a perfectly functional program
/// crash, so make sure that preconditions are actually absolutely required.
///
/// Note that by convention, in the VGC codebase, all pointers given as
/// arguments to functions are always assumed to be valid non-null pointers
/// unless specified otherwise. Therefore, in order to keep the code concise,
/// there is no need to check this as a precondition.
