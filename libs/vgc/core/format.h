/// \brief Utilities to format strings and write to output streams.
///
/// This file defines various write() functions for writing to output streams,
/// defines the class StringWriter for wrapping an std::string into an output
/// stream, and also defines convenient toString(), format(), and formatTo()
/// functions for formatting strings.
///
/// The template parameter OStream can be any type implementing the following
/// functions, with the same semantics as std::ostream:
///
/// \code
/// OStream& put(char c);
/// OStream& write(const char* s, std::streamsize count);
/// explicit operator bool() const;
/// \endcode

// For now, we directly use the format function from {fmt}. Later, we will
// either define our own function, or use C++20 when available.
//
// TODO: also define formatTo(). Note that we don't want to call it format_to()
// for consistency with our naming conventions, especially if it's not just a
// polyfill but has slightly different behaviour. The change of name makes it
// less trivial to define than just `using fmt::format_to`, so we've deferred
// this to later.

/// Writes the given `char` to the given output stream.

/// char c2 = 65; // = ASCII code for 'A'
/// vgc::core::write(out, c1); // write "a"
/// vgc::core::write(out, c2); // write "A"
/// ```
///
/// Note that throughout the VGC API, we use the type `char` to mean "one byte
/// of a UTF-8 encoded string", and the template parameter `OStream` to mean "a
/// UTF-8 encoded output stream". Therefore, calling this function writes the
/// given byte as is, without further encoding.
///
/// ```cpp

/// char c1 = 0xC3;
/// char c2 = 0xA9;
/// vgc::core::write(out, c1);
/// vgc::core::write(out, c2);
/// ```
///
/// Note that unlike when using std::ostream::operator<<, the types `signed
/// char` and `unsigned char` aren't writen as is, but instead converted to
/// their decimal representation. See `write(OStream& out, IntType x)` for more

///
/// ```cpp
/// vgc::Int x = 65;
/// vgc::core::write(out, x); // write "65"
/// ```
///
/// Note that unlike when using std::ostream::operator<<, the types `signed
/// char`, `unsigned char`, `Int8`, and `UInt8` are also converted to their
/// decimal representation:
///
/// ```cpp
/// signed char c = 'A';
/// unsigned char d = 'A';
/// vgc::Int8 i = 65;
/// vgc::UInt8 j = 65;
/// std::cout << c;           // write "A"
/// std::cout << d;           // write "A"
/// std::cout << i;           // write "A"

/// vgc::core::write(out, i); // write "65"

/// ```
///
/// Ideally, we would prefer to write the `signed char` and `unsigned char` as
/// "A", and the `Int8` and `UInt8` as "65". Unfortunately, this isn't possible
/// due to the annoying fact that `int8_t` (resp. `uint8_t`) is typically a
/// typedef for `signed char` (resp. `unsigned char`), rather than a separate
/// type.
///
/// For this reason, in VGC, we never directly use the types `signed char` or
/// `unsigned char`. Instead, we always use `Int8` or `UInt8`, and mean them to
/// actually represent an 8-bit integer, not an ASCII character.
