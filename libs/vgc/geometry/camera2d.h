/// \class vgc::geometry::Camera2d
/// \brief 2D camera using double-precision floating points.
///
/// This class is intended to be used for mouse navigation (e.g., pan,
/// zoom, rotate) in a 2D viewer via intuitive controls.
///
/// A 2D camera is defined via the following properties:
///
/// - center: 2D position, in world coordinates, which appears at the center of
///   the viewport.
///
/// - zoom: ratio between the size of an object in view coordinates (i.e., in
///   pixels), and its size in world coordinates. Example: if zoom = 2, then an
///   object which is 100-unit wide in world coordinates appears as 200 pixels
///   on screen.
///
/// - rotation: angle, in radian, between world coordinates and view coordinates.
///   Example: if angle = pi/4, then objects appear rotated 45 degrees
///   anti-clockwise.
///
/// - viewportWidth: the width of the viewport, in pixels.
///
/// - viewportHeight: the height of the viewport, in pixels.
///
/// Where:
///
/// - "World coordinates" refer to the coordinates of an object as authored by
///   the user. For example, in the following document, the world coordinates of
///   the vertex are (300, 100):
///
///   ```xml
///   <vgc>
///     <vertex position="(300, 100)" />,
///   </vgc>
///   ```
///
///   Note that the world coordinates of objects do not change when the user
///   pan, zoom, or rotate the view.
///
///   In SVG terminology, world coordinates are referred to as "user space".
///   For consistency with SVG, we use the convention that the Y-axis in
///   world coordinates is top-down:
///
///   ```text
///         o---> X
///         |
///         v Y
///   ```
///
/// - "Viewport" refers to the area of the screen where the VGC illustration
///   or animation is rendered.
///
/// - "View coordinates" refer to the coordinates of an object relative to the
///   viewport. For example, an object which appears exactly at the top-left
///   corner of the viewport has view coordinates equal to (0, 0). For
///   consistency with Qt (i.e., widget coordinates), we use the convention that
///   the viewport origin is top-left, and that the Y-axis is top-down:
///
///   ```text
///         o---> X
///         |
///         v Y
///   ```
///
///   Note that the view coordinates of an object change when the user pan,
///   zoom, or rotate the view. For example, an object A whose world
///   coordinates are (0, 0) may be initially rendered at the top-left corner
///   of the viewport, in which case its view coordinates are also (0, 0). But
///   if the user decides to center the viewport on the world origin, then the
///   view coordinates of A becomes (w/2, h/2), where (w,h) is the size of the
///   viewport in pixels.
///
/// In order to convert from world coordinates to view coordinates, one can
/// use the viewMatrix() associated with the 2D camera:
///
/// ```cpp
/// Vec2d viewCoords = camera.viewMatrix().transformAffine(worldCoords);
/// ```
///
/// This view matrix is always invertible, therefore we also have:
///
/// ```cpp
/// Vec2d worldCoords = camera.viewMatrix().inverse().transformAffine(viewCoords);
/// ```
///
/// The projectionMatrix() is provided for conveninence when using OpenGL. It
/// maps from view coordinates to NDC (normalized device coordinates), that is,
/// the top-left corner of the viewport (0, 0) is mapped to (-1, -1), and the
/// bottom
///
/// ```text
///       Y
///    ---^---  OpenGL NDC
///   |   |   |
///   |   o--->  X
///   |       |
///    -------
/// ```
///
/// Both the `viewMatrix()` and `projectionMatrix()` are 3x3 matrices that
/// represent a 2D transformation in homogeneous coordinates.
///
/// In order to convert this 3x3 matrix `m` to a 4x4 matrix (3D transformation
/// in homogeneous coordinates), you can use `Mat4d::fromTransform(m)`.
