/// \brief Represents a 2D curve with variable width.
///
/// This class is the preferred class to represent 2D curves in VGC
/// applications. Currently, only Catmull-Rom curves are supported, but more
/// curve types are expected in future versions.
///
/// Example 1: curve with constant width
///
/// \code
/// double width = 3;
/// Curve c(width);
/// c.addControlPoint(0, 0);
/// c.addControlPoint(100, 100);
/// c.addControlPoint(100, 200);
/// \endcode
///
/// Example 2: curve with varying width
///
/// \code
/// Curve c;
/// c.addControlPoint(0, 0, 3);
/// c.addControlPoint(100, 100, 4);
/// c.addControlPoint(100, 200, 5);
/// \endcode
///
/// In order to render the curve, you can call triangulate(), then render
/// the triangles using OpenGL.
///
