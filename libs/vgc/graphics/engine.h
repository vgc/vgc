///
/// This class is an abstract base class defining a common shared API for
/// graphics rendering. Implementations of this abstraction may provide
/// backends such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Direct3D, Metal, or software rendering.
///
/// The graphics engine is responsible for managing two matrix stacks: the
/// projection matrix stack, and the view matrix stack. When the engine is
/// constructed, each of these stacks is initialized with the identity matrix
/// as the only matrix in the stack. It is undefined behavior for clients to
/// call "pop" more times than "push": some implementations may emit an
/// exception (instantly or later), others may cause a crash (instantly or
/// later), or the drawing operations may fail.
