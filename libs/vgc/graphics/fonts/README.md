vgc.graphics ships with the following font family, which is used as default:

- Source Sans Pro, TTF, 2.021-ro-1.076-it
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?selection.family=Source+Code+Pro:200,200i,300,300i,400,400i,500,500i,600,600i,700,700i,900,900i

Note that we use older TTF versions hosted on Google Fonts, because the TTF
versions hosted on the Adobe GitHub have proven to cause trouble in the past,
