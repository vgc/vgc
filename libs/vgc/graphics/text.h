/// \brief Represents one grapheme of a shaped text.

/// This concept is typically used for text cursor navigation: you want the
/// cursor to advance grapheme by grapheme, rather than glyph by glyph or
/// codepoint by codepoint.
///
/// Indeed, several Unicode codepoints may be combined together to form a
/// single grapheme. Also, several glyphs may be necessary to render a single
/// grapheme.
///
/// Conversely, it is also possible for a single glyph to span several
/// graphemes, such as in the case of ligatures. For example, the text "ff" is
/// often rendered as one glyph, while represented as two codepoints, and
/// representing two graphemes.
///
/// Note that unlike glyphs, converting a Unicode text to a sequence of
/// graphemes does not depend on a choice of font, and in particular does not
/// require shaping. If you do not need shaping, you can directly use the class
/// TextBoundaryIterator to iterate over the graphemes of a given string, which
/// is much cheaper than creating a ShapedText.
///
/// However, if you do need shaping, then iterating over the ShapedGrapheme
/// elements of a ShapedText makes it possible to know the 2D location of the
/// graphemes, as well as the correspondence between the graphemes and glyphs.
/// In particular, it gives the advance and position of each grapheme,
