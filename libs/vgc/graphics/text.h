/// # Text segmentation
///
/// Text written in natural languages can typically be decomposed into text
/// elements such as graphemes ("user-perceived character"), words, and
/// sentences. Guidelines for determining the boundaries between these elements
/// is provided by the Unicode standard at:
///
/// https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29
///
/// Computing these boundaries is important in user interfaces, as it allows a
/// user to interact with the text in meaningful ways, for example, moving the
/// text caret one grapheme or one word at a time, selecting a word by
/// double-clicking on it, etc.
///
/// We call "significant" any word which is not only made of whitespace or
/// punctuaction. This is sometimes useful to navigate from word to word, by
/// automatically skipping whitespaces and punctuation.
///
/// # Line break opportunities
///
/// For word-wrapping purposes, it is important to know at which positions it
/// is prohibited, allowed, or mandatory to split a long line into multiple
/// lines. Guidelines for determining such line break opportunities are
/// provided by the Unicode standard at:
///
/// https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14
///
/// All line break opportunities, whether mandatory or optional, are marked
/// with the `LineBreakOpportunity` flag.
///
/// If the `MandatoryLineBreak` flag is set, then the line break is mandatory.
/// This typically occurs at the first position, the last position, or when a
/// "newline character" (CR or CRLF) is found.
///
/// If the `MandatoryLineBreak` flag is not set, then the line break is
/// optional. This typically occurs in two situations:
///
/// 1. At the beginning of a significant word, in which case the line can be
/// broken without any additional marking, and the `SoftHyphen` flag is set to
/// false.
///
/// 2. Just after an explicit soft hyphen character (U+00AD), or in the middle
/// of word at a position that is considered breakable based on an algorithm or
/// dictionary. In this case, the `SoftHyphen` flag is set to true, and a
/// hyphen mark should typically be added at the end of the line if one decides

/// This concept is typically used for text cursor navigation: you want the

/// Indeed, several Unicode codepoints may be combined together to form a

/// Note that unlike glyphs, converting a Unicode text to a sequence of

/// require shaping. If you do not need shaping, you can directly use the class
/// TextBoundaryIterator to iterate over the graphemes of a given string, which
