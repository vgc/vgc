# VGC Third-Party Dependencies

## About

This folder includes the source code (and utilities) of some of the
third-party dependencies of VGC, so that they are compiled alongside VGC and
don't need to be pre-installed beforehand.

## How to update?

### zlib

1. Delete the current `vgc/third/zlib` folder.
2. Download the latest `zlibz-1.x.y.tar.gz` from https://github.com/madler/zlib/releases
3. Uncompress to `vgc/third/zlib`
