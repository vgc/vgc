VGC is an upcoming suite of applications for graphic design and 2D animation,
in which the lines and shapes you draw are connected to each others both in
space and time, allowing for faster editing and inbetweening.

## Disclaimer

This project is still in very early development (pre-alpha) and doesn't yet
have any of the innovative features which make VGC unique. If you are curious,
you can try our earlier research prototype [VPaint](https://www.vpaint.org).
